#  build.properties - project specific property settings
#
#  This file contains overrides for build properties specified in
#  the generic profiles/system.properties.xml file. That file is
#  considered part of the core build system and should not be
#  modified directly. This file is loaded first allowing you to
#  provide your own settings for various value.

#  This file is committed into the repositroy, and as such is for
#  the project as a whole, not an individual person's environment.
